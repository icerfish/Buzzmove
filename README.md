# Whitbread Tech Test

Whitbread Tech test is a simple Android App written in Kotlin using the following Design Patterns, Libraries, or Framewortks:

  - MVP
  - Dagger 2
  - Retrofit
  - RxJava 2
  - Android Databinding

### Compiling

To compile the project please clone locally to your machine, then create a `secrets.properties` file at the root of the project. You can rename the `secrets-example.properties`. Then add your appropriate Foursquare client secret and client id to the corresponding fields. Once that is done, you should be able to compile and run the project using Android Studio.

### Development

For this application I used MVP/Kotlin/Dagger/RxJava to create this application. While I would have liked to do some Unit Testing or add more visual fidelity, due to being in Barcelona and using Dagger and implementing MVP for the first time I didn't have time to implement any testing.

However using MVP and Dagger while initially was a bit of learning curve, turned out to be a lot of fun to work with.
